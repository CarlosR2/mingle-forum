Updates by CarlosR2

I took the code from Cartpauj. The code was in the last stages of a rework but some stuff was not working, so i took it and fixed.

Things that I fixed:

-Delete files not needed anymore
-Fixed groups 2 user in the admin
-Added and option to display (but no access) to hidden forums
-No FS admin needed anymore
-Integrated wpf-insert.php 
-Fixed the user to group addition and deletion
-Got rid of fs-admin dependencies (now just need to clean the folder)
-Added new skins that found https://github.com/Xefir/mingle-forum-hacked (a hacked version of cartpauj)

Awesome, free Forum plugin for WordPress.

Note to developers:
Because the WordPress.org repository is SVN based, I will not be managing Tags at github.
Also, if I add you as a contibutor to the project, it's because I trust you, so no need to create any Forks or Branches, just push/pull to/from master.

Thanks,
Cartpauj
